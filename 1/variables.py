# variables are used to temporarily store data in the computers memory
# to declare a variable, type a name for the variable i.e name and assign it a value
name = "Bob"

# so the syntax (way to write code) for creating a variable is name_of_variable = VALUE
# * note that variable names cannot contain special characters other than underscore (#!)- etc) or start with a number
# * variable names should also be in lowercase and separated with an underscore
name_bob_1 = "Bob" # is valid
1_name_bob = "Bob" # is invalid because variable names cannot START with a number

# * Excercise
# identify valid and invalid variable names
# random_variablename
# randomvariable2
# a_2_name
# ab!_hi
# _abcd
