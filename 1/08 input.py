# input can be used to prompt the user for a string
str_value = input("Who are you?: ")
print(str_value)

# * Excercise
# 1. prompt the user for their name and birth year and print out the following
# Welcome _name_, you are _age_ this year!

# 2. write a calculator program that prompts for 2 values i.e
# value_one = input('please enter your first value')
# value_two = input('please enter your second value')
# and print the sum, difference (subtract), product (multiply), division and remainder of the two
