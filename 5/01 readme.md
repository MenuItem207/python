# Libraries
- Libraries are pre-built packages of code that can be easily imported into a python program
- They contain pre-written functions and classes to perform specific tasks

## Installing Libraries
Before we can start using libraries, we need to install them. The easiest way to install libraries in Python is using the pip package manager. Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install NumPy:

```
pip install numpy
```
Similarly, you can install Pandas and Matplotlib using the following commands:

```
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
```
