# lets say you wanna count to 10, you can either:
print("Counting: 1")
print("Counting: 2")
# ...
print("Counting: 10")

# OR you could use a FOR loop
for i in range(11):  # we put the number you want to stop BEFORE
    print("Counting: " + str(i))

# * Excercise
# figure out how to count to 100, starting from 50 and in multiples of 5
